SOURCES:
For my solution, I have decided to implement a solver based on the one presented by Graham Hutton on his Youtube channel of the same
name under his course Advanced Functional Programming. He in turn has based his solver on Professor Richard Bird´s solution, which
was originally implemented in Pearl. Both sources are linked below:

EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION:

-}

author :: String
author = "Jonas Richter"
nickname :: String
nickname = "jcric"


{-
numSolutions

Takes a Board and returns the number of ways that it can be completed into a solved Sudoku: 0, 1, or several.

RETURNS:
PARAMETERS:
SIDE EFFECTS: None. Also, no input or output operations from e.g. the console, file system or network are performed.
EXAMPLES:


-}

--numSolutions :: Board -> Solutions
--numSolutions = undefined -- remove `= undefined' and define your function here


numSolutions :: Board -> IO()
numSolutions b = print b
